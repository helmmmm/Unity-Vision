# Unity-Vision
 Hi there and welcome to Unity Vision ðŸ‘‹
 
 Unity Vision is a public repository of practice problems especially geared towards Game/XR(Extended Reality) Development. 
 
 I designed this repo for aspiring Game/XR devs that already have a foundational coding experience that want to dive deeper into Unity APIs, Unity Physics, and 3D/Vector math frequently used for Game/XR development!
